Introduction

   Connector is a network dialer frontend for Net4India Broadband Internet.

   Connector is developed in the Python programming language, and its
   interface is built with the GTK Toolkit. 

Installation
  
   The Connector's source package are provided in such a way that, if you have
   all the required software, it will run 'out-of-the-tarball'.

   The list of required software follows:
     * [1]Python 2.6 or higher
     * [2]GTK+ 2.6 or higher
     * [3]PyGTK 2.6 or higher

   After unpacking the source distribution do one of the following:
     * Double click the pycon file
     * Call the Python interpreter on the pycon.py file

   Unpack the source package, and get inside the extracted directory.

   # Extracting  gziped tarball
   $ tar xvzf Connector-0.1.tar.gz

   # Extracting bziped tarball
   $ tar xvjf Connector-0.1.tar.bz2

   # Extracting ziped source
   $ unzip Connector-0.1.zip

   After extracting the sources, get inside the extracted dir:
   $ cd Connector-0.1

   And then, run the command bellow as root:
   # python setup.py install


   This should be enough to get Connector installed.
   To run Connector:
   $ ./bin/pycon


   If you want to define the path where Connector should be installed, do:
   $ python setup.py install --prefix /path/to/connector_dir

   After that, put the /path/to/connector_dir/bin directory created in your PATH:
   $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/connector_dir/bin

   Or, put line above inside your ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
   (depending on your system) and this will get executed everytime you login.
   After putting the bin directory in the PATH, execute Umit:
   $ pycon

Build 'rpm' package for your Distribution 
   
   Unpack the source package, and get inside the extracted directory.

   # Extracting  gziped tarball
   $ tar xvzf Connector-0.1.tar.gz

   # Extracting bziped tarball
   $ tar xvjf Connector-0.1.tar.bz2

   # Extracting ziped source
   $ unzip Connector-0.1.zip

   After extracting the sources, get inside the extracted dir:
   $ cd Connector-0.1

   And then, run the command below :
   $ python setup.py bdist_rpm

   Connector-0.1-1.noarch.rpm and Connector-0.1-1.src.rpm packages will be 
   created in dist/

   Now, just install the rpm package as a root :
   # cd dist/
   # rpm -ivh Connector-0.1-1.noarch.rpm
